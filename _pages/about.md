My current research interests in the areas of Applied Linguistics and TESOL include: 
1) understanding teachers’ beliefs, teacher autonomy and classroom teaching practices in EFL contexts; 

2) understanding multilingual language use and language ideologies in internationalised universities; 

3) understanding the use of multilingual and multimodal resources in talk-and-bodies-in-interaction in multilingual and multicultural social contexts.

After graduating from Zhejiang Gongshang University (China) and Coventry University (UK) as an exchange student studying BA English and BA English for Business in 2011, I moved to Newcastle upon Tyne and studied Applied Linguistics and TESOL as an MA student at Newcastle University. Back then, I grew an interest in investigating language teachers’ beliefs and classroom practices in EFL contexts such as China, especially relating to the contextualisation and localisation of communication-oriented language teaching pedagogies (e.g., task-based language teaching, communicative language teaching).

In 2012, I continued my study in the area of Applied Linguistics at Newcastle University as a PhD student; I expanded my research interest in understanding classroom interaction and institutional talk using Ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis, with a special focus on speakership transitions and embodied conduct in small group student meetings. During my PhD study, I also worked as a Teaching Assistant at the School of Education, Communication and Language Sciences and taught the module “Task-based Language Teaching, Learning and Assessment” in 2012-2015, contributing to the postgraduate programme of [MA Applied Linguistics and TESOL](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/applied-linguistics-tesol-ma/#profile).

I obtained my PhD degree with the thesis titled “Shifting Embodied Participation in University Student Meetings” in 2017, then moved to Scotland and worked as a Research Assistant for [Dr Florence Bonacina-Pugh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/florence-bonacina-pugh) for her research project “Language Policy and Practice in the Multilingual University” at the University of Edinburgh in 2018; using Conversation Analysis and based on the notion of the ‘practiced’ language policy (Bonacina-Pugh, 2012), I examined language choice acts made by international postgraduate students in classroom teaching and learning contexts.

I joined Moray House School of Education and Sports at the University of Edinburgh since 2019 as an Associate Tutor in TESOL and Language Teaching, mainly contributing to postgraduate teaching and dissertation supervision for the two programmes, namely, [MSc TESOL](https://www.ed.ac.uk/education/graduate-school/taught-degrees/tesol) and [MSc Language Education](https://www.ed.ac.uk/education/graduate-school/taught-degrees/language-education). I also started working as a Visiting Lecturer back at Newcastle University in 2020, taking upon dissertation supervision responsibilities for the [MA Applied Linguistics and TESOL](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/applied-linguistics-tesol-ma/#profile) programme.
